**Project Title: POC Localization**

---

### Overview:
This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating the implementation of internationalization (i18n) using i18next library in a web application. Internationalization is crucial for making applications accessible to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds. With i18next, this project showcases how to seamlessly integrate multi-language support into your web applications.

### Features:
- **Internationalization Support:** The project demonstrates how to integrate i18next to enable support for multiple languages in the application.
- **Simple Setup:** With a clear setup guide, you can quickly get started with internationalization in your own projects.
- **Localization Files:** Explore the localization files provided in the project to understand how to structure and manage translations efficiently.
- **Dynamic Language Switching:** Learn how to implement dynamic language switching, allowing users to switch between languages on-the-fly.

### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moeeduxbert/POC-Localization.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd POC-Localization
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```


### Usage:
- Explore the provided codebase to understand how i18next is integrated into the project.
- Modify the localization files (`locales/*.json`) to add translations for additional languages.
- Experiment with dynamic language switching and observe how the UI adapts to different languages.
